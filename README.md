# RESERVIA
Welcome to RESERVIA, where we aim to provide you with an exceptional online hotel reservation experience. Our team has created a prototype website using HTML and CSS, implementing the latest development techniques such as Semantic HTML, CSS Flexbox, CSS Grid, and Responsive design to ensure a seamless and visually appealing user experience.

With our user-friendly interface and intuitive navigation, booking your dream hotel has never been easier. Our website is designed to be accessible on any device, so you can make reservations on-the-go with ease.

To get started with this project, you will need to download it first. Once downloaded, you can launch the project by opening the command terminal of your IDE, typing "NPM Start," and running it on your local server at port 3000.

At RESERVIA, we are committed to providing the best customer service and ensuring that our website is up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies. We understand that planning a trip can be stressful, and we aim to make the hotel reservation process as smooth and hassle-free as possible.

Thank you for choosing RESERVIA for your hotel reservation needs. We look forward to serving you!
